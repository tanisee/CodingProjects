Hi, I have uploaded  a few of the games I have created in both Java and Python and then taught to the students that I tutor. 
One of them is a basic chatbot, which was my final project for a computer science class that I took where I impersonated "chatting" with my dog
Let me know if you have any questions or would like me to explain anything!
